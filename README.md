# omnifood-website-project

Modern and stylish frontend for a website built for a fictional company called omnifood.

The website uses flexbox and grid layouts as and when required to come up with clean and professional look. It currently shows 2 pricing cards along with list of diets provided by the service. The main Call-to-action section comes in the end right before the footer. Until then the user goes through details on how the service works in the how-it-works section and is reinforced on the quality of the service via testimonial section and galleries.

Responsive UI with breakpoints placed at dimensions where the layout breaks rather than adhering to strict device widths ensure the website looks good in a wide range of screens. Following up on responsive UI, this front end properly emphasizes UX and its importance in Web Design with appropriate styling such as line heights, law-of-proximity & contrast ratios.
